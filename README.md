# GitPullRequest
Android app that lets you track the pull requests for your repository
---
## Getting Started
* Download zip or clone the repository.
* Open the project in android studio.
* Install the packages suggested by android studio.
* Run on device or emulator.

## Objective
* Fetch and display data from the GitHub API List PRs in the repo.
* You might want to show only open PRs. When a PR is selected, show the diffs for it. This should be the aggregate diffs of the whole PR, not broken down by commit.
* The diff should be a side-by-side style, similar to “Split” the way Github displays diffs.
* Use native Android (Java or Kotlin), not webview’s, javascript, etc. You can hard-code the app to point to any public repo you choose.
